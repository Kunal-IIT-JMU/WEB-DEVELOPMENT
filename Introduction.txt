Web Development has two basic parts : Frontend and Backend Development.
Frontend Development means developing the part of a website which is displayed to the user and the user can interact with.
Backend Develpment means developing the part of a website which is performed at the server and the user can't see these processes going on.

We Basically use 6 main languages or tools to make a basic website these are :
1. HTML = This is used to structure the website.
2. CSS = This is used to make the website attractive and beautiful.
3. JAVASCRIPT = This is used to provide website some Funtionality and Interactiveness.
4. Framework = These are used to speed up application development, reduce errors, simplify debugging and increase reliability.
5. Version Control = These are used to protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences. 
6. Databases = These are used to allow web developers to organise data in logical structures and retrieve it quickly and efficiently when needed.

First three come under Frontend Development while other three come under the Backend and These all come come togethor to make a basic website.
